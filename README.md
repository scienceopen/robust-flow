robust-flow
===========

Helper code used with Michael Black's Robust optical flow code
http://cs.brown.edu/people/black/code.html

This code was specially written for test purposes, so it's not so user-friendly. 
If you have interest in using Black's code with Matlab or Python, please start an 
issue and I can make this code more user friendly.
